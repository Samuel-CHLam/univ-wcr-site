      <p>At Univ, there are many student college societies run for members of the college to 
        fulfil many different potential interests. The societies are sometimes run soley 
        by WCR members, or jointly with JCR. If you have an interest in joining 
        any of these societies, you can get in touch with the listed contact for the 
        society of interest and find out how you can get involved. You can also join other 
        university societies as well.</p>
