    <ContentBlock title="IMPORTANT: Room Booking Regulation">
      <p>Make sure to abide with the room booking regulations if you wish to host event 
        within the college. In particular, you should first contact the domestic bursary 
        at <a href="mailto:hospitality@univ.ox.ac.uk">hospitality@univ.ox.ac.uk</a> to check availability 
        of college premises, or your fellow housemates if you want to host your event in 
        accommodations. You should then complete the "pink slip" at 
        the <a href="intranet.univ.ox.ac.uk">college intranet</a>, abiding the 
        following deadlines: (last updated: Michaelmas 2023)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 full working days for events held in college bars</li>
        <li>3 full working days for events held in college meeting rooms</li>
        <li>48 hours for events held in accommodations</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>You should also include details of external speaker in your application.</b> The 
        college reserves right to terminate any events that do not comply with the above 
        regulations. Organising or participating events without a pink slip may lead to 
        disciplinary actions.
      </p>
      <p><b>University clubs are not allowed to host events in the college unless booked by a college member 
        who is the president of the society. Event of such could not be advertised to general public.</b></p>
